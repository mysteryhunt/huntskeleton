  Argh! Someone messed up my notes for the reactions. If I just remembered which reactants go with which products I might remember what I need from the supply table to get my brew just right!
</p>

<p>
<b>Reactants:</b><br>
Molecular structure with two R groups on the same side relative to a double bond<br>
Sad teenage phase<br>
Hired mob thug<br>
First modular space station<br>
Japanese troll monster<br>
Long-needled conifer<br>
Abortion stance<br>
Serving of frozen dessert<br>
Disaster with a liquid
</p>

<p>
<b>Products:</b><br>
Branching lung structures<br>
To hold dear<br>
Unit of scoring in soccer<br>
Tiny creature unseen with the naked eye<br>
Explorer or frontiersman, for example<br>
Son of a monarch<br>
Impish rascal<br>
Durum wheat middlings<br>
Long-legged bird akin to an ibis
</p>

<p>
<b>Reactions:</b><br>
Hydrobromination. Adding fearsome quantities of <span class="block">&nbsp;</span> makes me breathe easy.<br>
Denitrosylation. I stole some extra <span class="block">&nbsp;</span> for the reaction and still no one cheered!<br>
Herz Reaction. Itâ€™ll be sad if you don&rsquo;t add enough <span class="block">&nbsp;</span> &mdash; it won&rsquo;t be grainy enough!<br>
Decarboxylation. You are free to decide to add <span class="block">&nbsp;</span> otherwise you&rsquo;ll be royally screwed.<br>
Deoxygenation. Add a portion of <span class="block">&nbsp;</span>, you troublemaker.<br>
Nitration. Pouring some <span class="block">&nbsp;</span> into the reaction is fly!<br>
Hydrogenation. If you have the right isomer adding <span class="block">&nbsp;</span> will give the most prized results!<br>
Carbonylation. Piece by piece get the <span class="block">&nbsp;</span> and add the smallest amount.<br>
Epoxidation. Add a green, tall container of <span class="block">&nbsp;</span> or you&rsquo;ll have to explore for better options.
