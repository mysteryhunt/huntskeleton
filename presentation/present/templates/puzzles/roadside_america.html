    <p>Dear Terry</p>

    <p>Checking in from The Mother Road! No Escalades or ATSs here!
      It&rsquo;s all old-school Coupes, covered in spray
      paint. You&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this, there&rsquo;s
      ten of them all lined up, nose down in the dirt, tail fins to
      the heavens! I tagged one for you.</p>

    <p>Do you have plans for the solstice yet? Since I can&rsquo;t
      meet up with my Druid brothers on Salisbury Plain this year,
      I&rsquo;ll make my pilgrimage to the other henge, the one in the
      American West. As I understand it, without the proper granite,
      the next best building material was old cars. Oh well, I&rsquo;m
      sure the gods will hear my prayers regardless.</p>

    <p>Ever wondered what it would feel like to jump a motorcycle over
      14 Greyhound buses? Wonder no longer! Just strap on your spangly
      leather jumpsuit and the VR goggles at this Sunflower State
      museum, and you&rsquo;ll just about be there. I&rsquo;m tempted
      to take this rocket-on-wheels for a spin&hellip;</p>

    <p>Hare Krishna! I feel like I&rsquo;ve stepped into a time
      machine, but I can&rsquo;t tell if I&rsquo;ve gone back to the
      60s, or back to the India of the Maharajas. This golden palace
      is fit for a spiritual leader, if only I could hear myself
      chanting over the fracking down the road.</p>

    <p>Hello from the American frontier! I don&rsquo;t know if Buffalo
      Bill ever really rode through here, but this museum is a
      gunslinger&rsquo;s paradise. I suppose all the guns people lost
      or dropped must end up somewhere, I just didn&rsquo;t think it
      would be here! This must be the only museum to put battlefield
      dirt on display.</p>

    <p>I must have rolled a 20, because I just found the coolest park
      in the world! I spent the morning running around a castle,
      shaking my fists at gremlins and goblins. You should come out
      here! Just be careful not to wake the sleeping dragon.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m converting! I&rsquo;ve decided to become an

      every Sunday. This house of worship is dope, I could contemplate
      this trippy art all day. Anyway, time to go! I want to say ten

    <p>I&rsquo;m writing from a house that gives a new meaning to the

      stir-crazy retiree with a taste for beer, and boom! The whole

    <p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to stand at the feet of a

    <p>No bishop would have his seat here!  Instead of carved stone,
      the walls are made of junk, and rather than being in the town
      square, it&rsquo;s in some guy&rsquo;s backyard (although the
      neighbors aren&rsquo;t too pleased about it). It&rsquo;s
      overgrown with vegetation but he&rsquo;s still building it, one
      old TV or broken ladder or destrung tennis racket at a time.</p>

    <p>The King of Rock and Roll didn&rsquo;t just have a pulsating

    <p>This particular walk in the woods has a little extra mystery to
      it. Towering redwoods stand among chainsaw carvings of woodland
      creatures, all visible from the gondolas strung high above. Paul
      Bunyan says &ldquo;Hi&rdquo;, as does Babe.</p>

    <p>To fluoridate, or not to fluoridate?  This hard water question
      has torn families apart. I stand at the foot of a huge statue
      that celebrates the town that first added this tiny little anion
      to water. Nothing like a 5 ton piece of wavy metal to fight
      tooth decay.</p>

    <p>Today I swore a Blood Oath to the mob. A virtual one, that is!
      And I learned how vast the web of organized crime really
      is. This museum, a former courthouse, celebrates the wiseguys
      just as much as the G-men who took them down. Maybe more,

    <p>Your dream of eating fettucini while gazing upon the

      than Michelangelo&rsquo;s delicate brushwork, you&rsquo;ll be
      gazing upon Paco&rsquo;s delicate spray-work while you twirl
      your fork into your pasta. Come gaze upon the fresco that used
      up all the spray paint in the area.</p>
