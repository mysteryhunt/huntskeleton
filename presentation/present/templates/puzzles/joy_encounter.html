She&rsquo;s excited, but in a rush, because she has to get back to the Control Room so that Terry can win Hunt. She gives a team member her trusty flashlight, and explains that it&rsquo;s the key to making anyone beam up in joy. After a few minutes, she says that she&rsquo;s needed back in the control room, and leaves.</p>
