<p>New to puzzle hunts? Don&rsquo;t be afraid. This content is a hint, too.</p>

<p>Puzzles tend not to have extra or random elements. Things are all
  the way they are for a reason. Did you know that the most common
  color for highlighters is that repulsive yellow?</p>

<p>The last stage of a puzzle that leads to the answer is called the
  extraction step. Very often a puzzle repeats its mechanic for the
  extraction stage.</p>

<p>The paragraphs are in alphabetical order. Hence you may need to
  rearrange them. Do the paragraphs match the grids somehow?</p>

<p>There is no flavor text. But the title can provide a hint too. Can
  you guess what is hidden in the grids?</p>

<p>Why would we mention Irish physicist and astronomer William Rowan
  Hamilton?</p>
