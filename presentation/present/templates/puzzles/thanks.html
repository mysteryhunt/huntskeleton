<p><pre>Awesome! I was outside seated on a bench (two trash containers before me). To my left, I see a brick non-building wall. Over a plant, the right sign&rsquo;s dedicated fondly to a   who is loving.</pre></p>

<p><pre>I go past a wavy, multicolored bench, went down the stairs by the   president sign, turned around and went back up and went left. There&rsquo;s a great place to find red places to sit! Neato!</pre></p>

<p><pre>I go past this plaque on my left indicating it was   in 1988&ndash;1990 and after crossing the street, looked left and saw an amazing description of a unit. Thanks so much for this!</pre></p>

<p><pre>I sat on a couch underneath a head, MIT   Only sign in front of me. I had to go outside, so I went up the stairs past the doors. I turned, looked up and discovered I wasn&rsquo;t late after all!</pre></p>

<p><pre>I start by entering the basement and I pass the   International office. Down the hall in the sitting area, I see a way I can use both of my thumbs to make streams of water appear! Whee!</pre></p>

<p><pre>I think this place is awesome! I was sitting on a bench here outside watching the water just barely cover the rocks. Beyond it, there&rsquo;s the bridge from Alexandria in   going over.</pre></p>

<p><pre>I was exiting a place for getting in. Directly across, I spot a sign listing at the bottom three things that were negative  . I turn right and on my left I see a lot of names on the wall!</pre></p>

<p><pre>I was looking at a room from above. I go down the stairs that turn left partway down. I go left. I see a glass sign mentioning a larger   program in front of a sleeping place for some!</pre></p>

<p><pre>I was very lost by a No   Allowed sign. I go outside after going around a pillar and up a ramp (elevator signs pointing where I came from). Now, I have to cross the street; I know where I am!</pre></p>
