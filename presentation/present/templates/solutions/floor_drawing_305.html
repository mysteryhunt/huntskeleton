<p>This puzzle consists of a description and the series of instructions similar to Sol Lewitt&rsquo;s <a href="http://massmoca.org/event/walldrawing305/">Wall Drawing 305</a>. The puzzle title, the description, and the instructions themselves are meant to clue that these instructions should be applied on Sol Lewitt&rsquo;s <a href="https://listart.mit.edu/public-art-map/bars-color-within-squares-mit">Bars of Colors Within Squares (MIT)</a>.</p>

<p>The instruction paragraphs come in two types: one where a series of numbered points are placed and one where lines are drawn using these numbered points. For each square of this artwork, solvers must take these instructions and find one paragraph of each type so that when the instructions are completed, three letters are drawn.</p>

<p>When the paragraphs have been assigned, the first letters of the paragraphs assigning the locations of the numbered points spell out <code>ADD TO FORM A CHAIN</code> and the first letters of the instructions drawing the lines spell out <code>FIVE LETTER WORDS</code> reading around the squares in counter-clockwise order.</p>

<p>The three-letter sequences are <code>ACA</code>, <code>FFA</code>, <code>IMB</code>, <code>LDE</code>, <code>EAL</code>, <code>UFT</code>, <code>ONI</code>, <code>HAI</code>, <code>ETR</code>, <code>RAN</code>, <code>OFE</code>, <code>UMB</code>, <code>TRI</code>, <code>ATC</code>, and <code>OLL</code>; the orientation of these letters read so that the bottoms of the letters are on the outside of the artwork (so the first five read with the letter bottoms being on the left side).</p>

<p>Add a letter on either side of each three-letter sequence so that the letter added to the end of one sequence is the letter inserted before the next one forms the chain: <code>CACAO</code>, <code>OFFAL</code>, <code>LIMBO</code>, <code>OLDER</code>, <code>REALM</code>, <code>MUFTI</code>, <code>IONIC</code>, <code>CHAIR</code>, <code>RETRO</code>, <code>ORANG</code>, <code>GOFER</code>, <code>RUMBA</code>, <code>ATRIP</code>, <code>PATCH</code>, and <code>HOLLY</code>. The letters added form the answer <strong><code>COLOR MICROGRAPHY</code></strong>.</p>
