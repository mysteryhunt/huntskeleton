<p>This puzzle is about the board game <a href="http://slugfestgames.com/games/rdi/" target="_blank"><i>Red Dragon Inn</i></a>. This is clued by the inclusion of Fortitude and Alcohol on the citations and by the character names in the flavor text.</p>

<p>The flavor text also includes conspicuous shortening of some words, and the word &ldquo;u &rsquo;n&rsquo; tapp&rsquo;d&rdquo; can be found stretched across a few words. <a href="https://untappd.com" target="_blank">Untappd</a> is a beer tracking app, and searching for the characters in untappd will lead to the four users: <a href="https://untappd.com/user/Deirdre_the_Priestess" target="_blank">Deirdre_the_Priestess</a>, <a href="https://untappd.com/user/Fiona_the_Volatile" target="_blank">Fiona_the_Volatile</a>, <a href="https://untappd.com/user/Gerki_the_Sneak" target="_blank">Gerki_the_Sneak</a>, and <a href="https://untappd.com/user/Zot_and_Pooky" target="_blank">Zot_and_Pooky</a>.</p>

<p>At this point, solvers will play through the game of <i>Red Dragon Inn</i>, as shown with the untappd check-ins. Each beer corresponds to a drink in the deck, each location change and 30 minute time span indicates a new round.</p>

<p>When a player takes an action early in a round they will sometimes target a player who has not yet checked in for that round on their profile. In these cases the action will appear as a comment on a check in for a previous round, but the timestamp makes it clear that the action was taken during the current round.</p>

<p>Drinks are as follows (in order of first check-in):</p>

<table class="solution-table">
  <tr>
    <th>Game drink</th>
    <th>Untappd drink</th>
    <th>Brewery</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Elven Wine</td>
    <td>Dark Elf Chocolate Mint Porter</td>
    <td>Periodic Brewing</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wine</td>

    <td>Lervig</td>

    <td>Atwater Brewing</td>

  <tr>

    <td>Citizen Cider</td>

    <td>Troll Swill</td>
    <td>Happy Troll</td>
    <td>Ethereal Meads</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Orcish Rotgut</td>
    <td>Symmetric Orchestra</td>
    <td>Modern Times</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Dragon&rsquo;s Breath</td>
    <td>Dragonstooth Stout</td>
    <td>Elysian</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Holy Water</td>
    <td>Holy Water Citra IPA</td>
    <td>Sumerian</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>If solvers read the first letter of the breweries in check-in order, they will find a clue phrase: <code>PLACE NAMES</code>.</p>

<p>Careful solvers will play through the game and find the end results as:</p>

<table class="solution-table">
  <tr>
    <th>Place</th>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Fortitude</th>
    <th>Alcohol</th>
    <th>Last check-in</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4th</td>
    <td>Zot</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>7</td>
    <td>Microsoft 1 Cambridge Center</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3rd</td>
    <td>Gerki</td>
    <td>9</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>Hogan&rsquo;s Alley</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2nd</td>
    <td>Fiona</td>
    <td>18</td>
    <td>19</td>
    <td>Intersystems Corporation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1st</td>
    <td>Deirdre</td>
    <td>18</td>
    <td>14</td>
    <td>Intersystems Corporation</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>If solvers index by Fortitude and Alcohol content into the last check-in place name, they will get a bigram for each character:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Zot: <code>S O</code></li>
  <li>Gerki: <code>L E</code></li>
  <li>Fiona: <code>R A</code></li>
  <li>Deirdre: <code>R O</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Discounting Deirdre, since she did not pass out, the final solution is <strong><code>SOLERA</code></strong>.</p>
