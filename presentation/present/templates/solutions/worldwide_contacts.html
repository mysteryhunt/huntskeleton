  <p>
    The puzzle opens with just the puzzle title and thirteen interactive maps embedded in the
    page. Below the interactive maps is a static copy of a blank map with the same
    projection.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each map is plotting a different category, but the solver is only presented with markers for
    the relevant countries. They can hover over the markers in order to get the values for those countries. Above
    each map is a list of 1-3 countries that are not plotted, and a number in parentheses.
  </p>
  <p>
    Solving each map results in a international calling country code, and the letter is extracted
    by indexing into the name of the country provided by the country code. The solver must determine the theme of
    each map in order to map the appropriate values onto the missing countries, and then concatenate the values in
    the same order as the countries in the list.
  </p>
  <p>
    The maps are in alphabetical order by extracted country name to help the solver know they are
    on the right track.
