<p>In this runaround, you need to follow the path provided. At certain points, you will need to match up the drawings with your surroundings, answer the paranoid question given, and extract a particular letter given the enumeration and index on the drawing. There is also one point where solvers must jump two stories using the <code>EXOSKELETON</code> in order to proceed with the directions.</p>

<p>Putting together the letters given provides you with the runaround answer: <strong><code>TRUST NO ONE</code></strong>.</p>

<p>Detailed explanation of the path follows:</p>
