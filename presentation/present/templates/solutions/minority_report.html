      Even though it happens mostly in England, this movie is a classic American
      action movie. Lots of gun action? Check. Lots of dead bad guys? Check.
      Lots of honorary American Gerard Butler kicking ass and taking names?
      Double, triple, quadruple check.

      It&rsquo;s always painful when a franchise lurches back to life, much more so when
      the original was so well regarded as launching a genre. Seventeen years on,
      this direct sequel feels more like the reanimated remains of a rotting corpse
      than a new installment.

      It&rsquo;s easy to dismiss Pixar&rsquo;s current trend of chasing sequels as nothing but
      creative laziness, but this follow-up to a 2003 film has turned out to be more
      than a worthy successor, giving us the full tale on one of the most
      memorable characters the studio ever created. Thumbs way up.

      I am sick and tired of the animated movie switcheroo: you take your kids to
      something with a bunch of fuzzy animals that won&rsquo;t drive you nuts, and the
      movie ends up being about cutesy violent warriors that can&rsquo;t die.
      Apparently, the only character who can die is the main character&rsquo;s mom.
      Good job, Hollywood.

      I wish I lived the life in this movie! Gabby is a medical student who&rsquo;s in a
      relationship with Ryan, but while he&rsquo;s out of town, hunky Travis whisks her off
      her feet and literally wins her heart when he and Ryan get into a fight. I can&rsquo;t

      basically live happily ever after, so it all worked out in the end.

      Call me a curmudgeon, but I struggle to find the merit in yet another liveaction,
      CG-laden adaptation of a fairy tale. This movie is especially
      egregious: Why bother using the Snow White branding if you&rsquo;re going to
      make a movie that bears absolutely no resemblance to the source material?
      Sometimes I think all of Hollywood would curl up and die if they didn&rsquo;t have
      the coattails of already-established franchises to ride on.

      It’s the latest cinematic vogue to spotlight damaged or unstable women in

      Viola Davis absolutely earned her Academy Award in a heartbreaking film

      Why do directors hate numbers so much? When I go to see the Nth
      installment of a series, I expect it to be called “<i>Series Name N: Return of the
      thing!</i>”, not just “<i>Series Name&hellip; again</i>” or even worse
      “<i>Main Character</i>”. If numbered sequels were good enough for <i>Star Wars</i> and
      <i>Die Hard</i> then they&rsquo;re good enough for this knock-off spy movie
      nonsense. Just to clear things up for first-time viewers, this movie is NOT the
      first in its series&mdash;it&rsquo;s the fifth.

      It’s almost comical to compare this film to <i>Gone Girl</i>, against which it comes

      It&rsquo;s amazing how large of a juggernaut the original was for its time, given its
      shoestring budget of $60,000. This sequel expertly delivers by returning to the

      horror and legends that made the first movie a classic of the genre.

      Like the mysterious, monolithic alien structures that drive the film itself, this

      Ever since Disney&rsquo;s <i>Aladdin</i>, no animated feature can resist signing up big
      names for big characters. This is the first such venture for Matthew
      McConaughey, and it&rsquo;s hard to say he was a positive contribution to a
      clumsy film that was already tent-poled by A-listers. Without fail, his drawl
      breaks immersion in a movie that is ostensibly set in Japan.

      Something smells fishy in the theater, and it&rsquo;s this flop of a movie. Imagine
      the following: An animated children&rsquo;s movie comes out about a bunch of
      adorable ocean creatures, and everybody falls in love with it. Then, a few
      years later, a sequel comes out that involves the SAME adorable ocean
      creatures, but this time instead of having an adventure, we&rsquo;re delving into
      the existential horror that afflicts them due to the very real and adult mental
      illness that one of the cute little fish is struggling with. That is this movie.
      Oddly dark, tone deaf to its audience of kids, and totally not worth your
      time.

      This movie is spastic unbearable schlock. If I&rsquo;d wanted to spend 90 minutes
      watching hairy overweight weirdos eat dumplings and attack each other, I
      would have gone to dinner with my in-laws.

      This movie stands as immortal proof that no matter how much Hollywood Alist
      talent, advanced CGI and money you have, you still cannot save a film
      which has a sufficiently stupid premise. Serving as both sequel AND prequel
      to its predecessor, this fairy-tale themed nightmare is a blight on the career
      of everyone who worked on it.

      What would life be like in a world where individuals have the power to level

      film which does credit to its beloved brand. Whose side will you

      A horribly disappointing sequel from director Babak Najafi, the action

      Hollywood&rsquo;s response to superhero fatigue: Double-down. Then double
      down again. Then throw in a bunch more superdudes until we have
      absolutely no idea who we&rsquo;re seeing or what they do, then have them fight
      each other for stupid contrived reasons until nothing makes sense anymore
      and I walk out of the theater and get drunk. At least they toned it down on
      the helicarriers this time.

      Like its sister film, <i>Sicario</i>, this delightful new
      venture by Denis Villeneuve explores the capability of the
      people to rise to meet the challenges set before them. In this
      case, the conceit is the threat of a mysterious alien race that
      talks in Jackson Pollock paintings, but Amy Adams&rsquo;s acting
      elevates a story about grief, time, communication, compassion
      and, ultimately, catharsis.

      Stop me if this plot sounds familiar: A little kid with dead parents is forced by
      the actions of an evil relative to embark on a 90-minute quest rife with
      toyetic companions and marketable enemies in order to gain vague set of
      superpowers that involve believing in yourself, somehow allowing the kid to
      defeat a full-grown adult with infinitely more knowledge, experience and
      power. Pour a little Japanese-flavored batter into that tired old mold, frost it
      with some musicality and voila! You&rsquo;ve got this uninspired CGI cupcake.

      The romance between leads Benjamin Walker and Teresa Palmer absolutely
      sparks in this movie. If you&rsquo;re looking for a good excuse to laugh, cry and

      This shapeless entry to a once-beloved franchise feels utterly lifeless and
      perfunctory. I mean sure, it hits all of the obligatory standbys like shaky-cam
      fight sequences and globetrotting espionage, but the whole enterprise feels
      like the last sad twitches of a well-beaten dead horse. If I had to sum this
      unfortunate movie up in single word, I would call it “stillborn”.

      Watching this film is kinda like going out for drinks with your coworkers, then
      getting trapped listening to one of them drunkenly cry about their recent
      breakup all night: You thought you were signing up for some lighthearted fun
      with a couple people you sorta like, but you ended up getting a cringingly
      awkward look into their horrifying personal issues. Slap a cutesy ocean motif
      on that, and you&rsquo;ve pretty much got this movie. I would erase this from my
      mind if I could.

  Group the reviews by movie. Notice that each set of movie reviews has one dissenting
  opinion. This is suggested by the title, &ldquo;Minority Report&rdquo;. In the movie,
  three &ldquo;Precogs&rdquo; receive visions of future crimes. One of the Precogs is
  susceptible to having a conflicting vision&ndash;this is the &ldquo;minority report&rdquo;.
  Use the number from the dissenting opinion as an index into the movie’s title.
