<p>Each journal entry clues a set of peaks on the map of a national park in the US (in alphabetical order by park name). The first sentence is a clue about the park name and/or location. The paragraphs are below with the clues bolded and the peaks listed under each entry. Each entry has a different mechanic hiding the peak names. The clue in the last entry hints that you need to mark the peaks on maps in order of occurrence in the journal entry. When you draw lines between points in this order, a letter is drawn on the map.</p>
